## Available Scripts

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

then start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Building

To create an optimised version of the app:

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `public/build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles the application in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
